            <li>
             For making Syrup add water, sugar and a slice of lemon in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil stir continiously untill the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Then let it cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat the oven to 350°F and brush a baking dish melted butter. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Trim the phyllo sheets to fit your baking pan. Cover it with a damped cooking towel. To prevent it from drying out or breaking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully take out one phyllo sheet from the stack and place it on the bottom of the baking tray. Brush the phyllo sheet lightly with melted butter. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuing to layer 5-6 more phyllo sheets on top, brushing each sheet with butter until 10 sheets of phyllo have been stacked in<br> <!-- br to break the line of text --> the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle ½ of the crushed Wallnuts over the phyllo base in<br><!-- br to break the line of text --> an even layer.  
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat the process to create another 8-10 sheet layer of phyllo and melted butter, followed by the remaining ½ of the crushed Wallnuts, and another top layer made up of the remaining phyllo sheets and butter. Slice into 36 pieces with a sharp knife in <br><!-- br to break the line of text --> square shape, making sure to always cut through all layers of phyllo. 
            </li>
              <li>
              Bake for 60 minutes, until the top is golden brown, and the bottom phyllo layers are baked through. Use a knife to lift up a corner <br><!-- br to break the line of text -->of one of the square to see if the bottom layers are done. Check the baklava after 40 minutes and cover with a piece of foil over <br> <!-- br to break the line of text -->the top if the baklava is getting too browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the baklava is done, remove from oven and slowly pour the cold syrup over the baklava while its still hot. Sprinkle the top <br><!-- br to break the line of text --> of each piece of baklava with the remaining finely grounded pistachios.
            </li>
            <li>
              let it cool in the room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
              When it's completely cooled down serve it with turkish cofee without sugar as baklava is already sweet.
