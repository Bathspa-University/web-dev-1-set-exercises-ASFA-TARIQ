                This is a rare drama in that it really is an all-rounder: its entertaining, smart, funny, poignant, and creepy. It has a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly suits the story line, eerie cinematography that keeps you 
                grounded in the material, and a smart, well written plot that comes full circle.Most (if not all) questions are answered by the end of the show, and even though many episodes focus on a single story line (i.e. Ghost of the week) 
                the episodes never feel like filler and the show never gets boring. Jang Na-Ra and Jung Yong-Hwa were a great pair and I found the lack of annoying romantic subplots somewhat refreshing. Na Ra really shone at the end, her 
                performance in the last episode was outstanding.<br>

                There is no romance and that's a first. This drama is a horror drama with comedy. It's really entertaining and fun to watch. Its storyline is simple but it never gets boring or clich√©. It shows a new way of exorcising ghosts and they have done 
                a good job at that. It also gives importance to the life of every character in the show. Overall, it's a simple show that you can watch without getting bored. <br>

                This series is fairly good with a solid story and an interesting theme. In the occult scene, this one can hold its own. The series also explore its own world while exploring past events that impacted the present of the main 2 characters. 
                The story focuses more on the tragic story, exorcism and everything related to it. The romantic angle is kept to a minimum probably to create an extreme atmosphere of stress. If you are into such themes, this one will be a good one to watch. <br>

                <b>Premise also looks better on paper </b> <br>

                No, it's not as bad as 6 stars, on premise. Butnwhat if the script had more of the business side of things instead of the ghost side? But instead one can foresee the usual plot points.
                That the scammer and the real ghost hunters works together complimentary to each other. And their fate and past are neatly tied together.
                The intermittent cases all serves as plot point leading up to the final confrontation and reveal and resolve of their history. Nothing too exciting here.
                To be fair, I really like the main lead actress here. Her air of melancholy, distain and almost direct sarcasm stands out for om the rest of the cast. <br>
